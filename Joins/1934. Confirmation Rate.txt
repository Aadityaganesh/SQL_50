/*
Write a SQL query to calculate the confirmation rate for each user in the Signups table. The confirmation rate is defined as the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of confirmation requests made by each user in the Confirmations table. For users who did not request any confirmation messages, their rate should be 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places, and return the result in any order.

SELECT s.user_id, 
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN c.action = 'confirmed' then 1 else 0 END)/COUNT(*),2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN Confirmations c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY user_id;
